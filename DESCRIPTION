Description: An implementation of the method described by Serfling (1963) in
    "Methods for Current Statistical Analysis of Excess Pneumonia-Influenza Deaths".
    This work was based on a collaboration with the Washington State Department of Health. 
    The goal of the project was to implement an approach for defining influenza epidemic onset.
    This has several public health implications, including decisions regarding the
    enforcement of masking in clinical settings.
